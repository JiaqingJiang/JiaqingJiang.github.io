<p>
I am a PhD student at Caltech, advised by <a href="http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/">Thomas Vidick</a>. I am broadly interested in quantum information and theoretical computer science. Recently, I am pretty interested in Hamiltonian Complexity, understanding algorithms/hardness for computing ground energy and constructing ground states. I am also working on interactive proofs and zero-knowledge.
